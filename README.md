# The AI-Powered eDNA Analysis System is an end-to-end platform that analyzes environmental DNA (eDNA) from ocean water to automatically:

Detect known species,Identify potential new species,Predict ecological interactions,Track biodiversity drift across seasons and locations,Provide visual insights through a modern dashboard and Offer explanations using a built-in chatbot assistant

This system enables deep-sea biodiversity discovery even in regions where 91% of species remain unknown.

❗ Problem

Current marine biodiversity analysis faces major limitations:

80%+ of deep-sea species are unclassified

Dependence on incomplete databases (NCBI, SILVA)

Manual species identification takes weeks

Existing tools cannot detect novel species

No pipeline tracks biodiversity drift over time or space

🚀 Proposed Solution

A fully automated AI-driven eDNA intelligence pipeline that:

1. Cleans and preprocesses raw DNA

Automated QC removes noise, trims low-quality reads, and extracts k-mers.

2. Embeds sequences using DNABERT

Treats DNA like a language → converts sequences into meaningful embeddings.

3. Classifies known species & clusters unknown ones

Hybrid ensemble models + unsupervised clustering.

4. Predicts ecological roles

CNN–GNN hybrid model infers interactions such as predator–prey, competition, and food-chain networks.

5. Tracks biodiversity drift

Shows how species change based on season, location, depth, or expedition.

6. Interactive Dashboard

Species maps

Abundance graphs

Shannon/Simpson indices

Alerts for endangered/invasive species

7. Built-in Chatbot

Explains results in simple language — useful for non-experts.

8. Optional Blockchain Reporting

Ensures scientific data integrity.
